		<h1>Properties</h1>
		<h4>Component properties are the attributes of a component-- they define how the component will appear (and other things).</h4>

	

	<h4>For instance, the Button.Text property defines the text that appears on a button. You can set the value of a property in the designer, which changes the initial value. But you can also change a property as an app runs with blocks, using a set block:</h4>
	
	<img class="responsive-fullwidth-img" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/image01_pcworksheet.png" width="60%" height="10%" >
	
	<h4>Similarly, you can check the value of a property with a “get” block, as in these examples:</h4>
	
	<img class="responsive-fullwidth-img" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/image00_pcworksheet.png" width="60%" height="10%">
	</div>
	
	<div class="card">
	<h1>Conditionals</h1>
	<h4>Conditionals allow the app to ask questions and determine which blocks to execute based on the answer. Consider again the conditional (if-else) blocks used in the “I Have a Dream” app:</h4>

	
	<img class="responsive-fullwidth-img" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/image02_pcworksheet.png" width="60%" height="10%">
	

	<h4>When a button is clicked, If a speech is already playing, it will pause it. Otherwise (else) it will start it. The blocks in the “then” slot and “else” slot are only conditionally executed.</h4>

	</div>
	
	<div class="card">
	<h1>Practice</h1>
	<h4>To practice using If-conditionals and properties, sketch blocks for:</h4>

	<ol>
		<li>Each time a button named “Button1” is clicked, its text toggles between “Start” and “Stop”. So the first time it is clicked, the text on the button changes from “Start” to “Stop”. The second time it changes back to “Start”, and so on.</li>
		<li>Each time the button is clicked, it toggles between three values, “A”, “B”, and C”.</li>
		<li>Each time the button is clicked, it shows one of three different images (e.g., pics of MLK, Malcolm X, and Rosa Parks).</li>

	</ol>
