	<p>This module is the teachers companion to the  <a href="/content/CourseInABox/Intro">Student Introduction Module</a>.
	<p>The purpose of the Introduction Module is to acclimate students with
		App Inventor and get them excited about creating apps. They learn the
		fundamentals of using the App Inventor environment, learn that an app
		consists of event handlers, and they're introduced to "if" conditions. The
		module culminates in their first creative project, a Soundboard app.  </p>

		<h2>Schedule</h2>
		<p>I usually begin with a short introduction lecture on App Inventor highlighted
		by a demo: creating the "Raffle" app and giving away a prize.
		As soon as possible I have students build an app themselves, the "I Have a Dream"
		app, following the step-by-step instructions in the tutorial.
		</p>
		<p>Next, I lead the students away from following instructions and instead
		thinking and creating on their own. We typically do the following:
		
		<ol>
		<li>Conceptualization: Students work in groups on conceptual "pen and paper"
		questions, and we discuss answers as a class. Here students will begin learning terminology
		such as "event handler" and "if-conditional".
		</li>
		<li>Customization: Students are assigned small programming customizations of the
		"I Have a Dream" app, without step-by-step instructions.
		</li>
		<li>Maker Cards: Students can choose from a set of cards that introduce a component
		(e.g., VideoPlayer) and let them explore and create with it.
		</li>
		<li>Creative Project: Students design and build some type of Soundboard app, typically
		in teams of 2.
		</li>
		</ol>
		<p>As part of the creative project, I have students create a portfolio for the class
		and post their first project there and in the App Inventor gallery. Be sure and reserve
		ample time for this setup and for the students to learn how to "publish" their apps
		to their portfolios.
		</p>
		<p>The Introduction Module requires about 8 hours of class time. This allotment
		can be smaller or larger based on how much time is allotted for the creative work including
		the Maker Cards and the Soundboard project.

		<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Learn the mechanics of using App Inventor to build apps.</li>
	<li>Learn how to design an app’s user interface with the App
		Inventor Designer, and its behavior with the Blocks Editor.</li>
	<li>Understand that an app’s behavior consists of event handlers--
		blocks that specify how an app responds to each event.</li>
	<li>Understand that an app can make decisions using a conditional
		(if) block.</li>
	<li> Understand that a component has a set of properties and that a property
	is a memory cell that can be changed to modify how a component looks and behaves.
	</li>
	<li>Learn how to test an app, how to deploy it to a device, and
		how to publish it on a portfolio and the App Inventor Gallery.</li>
