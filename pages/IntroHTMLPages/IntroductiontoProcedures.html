		<h2>Algorithms</h2>
		<p >
			An <b>algorithm</b><span class="c3 c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">is
				a </span><span class="c15">step-by-step set of operations to be
				performed to solve a problem.</span>
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">An algorithm is like a recipe, but more
				precise.</span>
		</p>
		<p >
			
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">A </span><span class="c3 c9">procedure</span><span
				class="c3">&nbsp;is a named set of blocks, a realization of
				an algorithm for a specific computer and programming language.</span>
		</p>
		<p >
			
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">Recall the moveRandom procedure used in
				AndroidMash:</span>

		<p >
			<span class="c3">MoveRandom provides a name for some
				complicated blocks. Once you create the procedure, you have a new
				block, moveRandom, which you can call as in the example. </span>
		</p>
		<p >
			
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">Using procedures is key to programming and
				how programmers use abstraction to break down problems. Consider
				this from Ellen Spertus in </span><span ><a 
				href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.appinventor.org%2FbookChapters%2Fchapter3.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyVlHNIG-AgL0OLVbPFVpgf_dYlw">chapter
					3</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of the App Inventor 2 book.</span>
		</p>
		<p >
			
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c14">
			<span class="c3 c5">The ability to name and later call a set
				of instructions like moveRandom is one of the key tools in computer
				science and is referred to as </span><span class="c3 c5 c9">procedural
				abstraction</span><span class="c3 c5">. It is called
				&ldquo;abstraction&rdquo; because the caller of the procedure (who,
				in real-world projects, is likely to be di&#130;fferent from the
				author of the procedure) only needs to know what the procedure does
				(moves the mole), not how it does it (by making two calls to the
				random number generator). Without procedural abstraction, big
				computer programs would not be possible, because they contain too
				much code for individuals to hold in their head at a time. This is
				analogous to the division of labor in the real world, where, for
				example, di&#130;fferent engineers design di&#130;erent parts of a
				car, none of them understanding all of the details, and the driver
				only has to understand the interface (e.g., pressing the brake pedal
				to stop the car), not the implementation.</span>
		</p>
		<p >
			
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">Essentially, a procedure lets you name some
				detailed instructions then use that name (that block) elsewhere in
				your program. The &ldquo;abstraction&rdquo; lets programmers focus
				on the overall problem at different levels of detail. Here are just
				some of the advantages of using procedures:</span>
		</p>
		<p >
			
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">&bull; If you need to fix a bug or change
				something, it only needs to be changed in one place. </span>
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">&bull; Procedures can be collected into a
				library and used in di&#130;fferent programs. </span>
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">&bull; Breaking code into pieces helps you
				&ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo; a problem.</span>
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">&bull; It is easier to test code if it is
				neatly segregated from the rest of the program. </span>
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">&bull; Procedures make it easier for someone
				else (or you, a month later) to read the code.</span>
		</p>

		<h2>Procedures</h2>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">When procedures are used, an app now becomes
				a set of event handlers along with supporting procedures. Event
				handlers can call the procedures, and procedures can call
				procedures, as shown below:</span>

				and Screen.Initialize both call displayList:</span>

		<h2>Logo</h2>

		<p >
			<span class="c3">Logo is a classic drawing app that was one of
				the first programming environments for kids. You can draw using some
				simple primitive blocks. In this first Android Logo version, the
				following procedures (blocks) have been defined for you:</span>
		</p>
		<p >
			
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp;forward &nbsp;-- moves the
				android ahead 10 pixels</span>
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp;turn -- rotates the android 90
				degrees<br> &nbsp; penup -- if the pen is up you can move
				android but not draw
			</span>
		</p>
		<p >
			<span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp;pendown -- if the pen is down
				drawing happens on forward.</span>
		</p>

		<p >
			<span>1. Starting with the Logo Starter app, code a procedure
				named </span><span class="c9 c10">square40</span><span>&nbsp;that
				draws a 40-by-40 square. Then modify the </span><span class="c10">draw</span><span>&nbsp;procedure
				so that it calls the </span><span class="c10">square40</span><span>&nbsp;procedure.
				Test your app: when the user clicks the &ldquo;Draw&rdquo; button,
				it should draw your square.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1">
			<span></span>
		</p>
		<p >
			<span>2. Design an algorithm for drawing a face with a large
				square for the head, 2 small squares for eyes, and a line for the
				mouth (nose optional). &nbsp;Design at least four procedures you
				need &nbsp;to help simplify this problem. First sketch your design
				out on paper, then actually code it.</span>
