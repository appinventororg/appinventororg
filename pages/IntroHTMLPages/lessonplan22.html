	<p class="c3">
		<span>The following tasks can be assigned as programming tasks
			using App Inventor, or you can ask the students to sketch the blocks
			on paper.</span>
	</p>
	<ul class="c8 lst-kix_hagezxwsgyk0-0 start">
		<li class="c1"><span>Assign students the task of playing a
				sound every five seconds. You can provide them with a sound clip,
				which should be a short one. After a few minutes, demonstrate the
				solution: </span><span>http://appinventor.org/TimedActivity</span></li>
		<li class="c1"><span>Assign the students the task of
				making an image sprite (e.g., spaceship) move smoothly across the
				screen. After a few minutes, demonstrate the solution:
				appinventor.org/TimedActivity#spaceship</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p class="c0">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span>Emphasize that any blocks you put in Clock.Timer will be
			executed over and over, every Clock.TimerInterval milliseconds. Be
			sure and explain that a millisecond is 1/1000 second.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span>Emphasize also that in App Inventor time is treated as
			just another event. Ask them to name all the events they have dealt
			with. Thus far they have been user interface events-- button clicks
			and Canvas.Dragged events. But mention external events like
			Texting.Message Received and LocationSensor.LocationChanged (for when
			a GPS reading comes in), and of course timer events.</span>

			&ldquo;AndroidMash&rdquo;(45)</span>
	</h1>
	<p class="c3">
		<span>Ask the students to build MoleMash using the book chapter
			tutorial: </span><span>http://www.appinventor.org/MoleMash2</span><span>&nbsp;or
			the AndroidMash using the video </span><span>http://www.appinventor.org/AndroidMash-steps.
			The tutorials are essentially the same, but you should go over the
			one(s) you use carefully so you&rsquo;ll be ready for student
			questions.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span>Optionally, ask the students to create a portfolio page
			and post the MoleMash app on it. You may want to do this to ensure
			students complete these tasks and/or for the students to have a
			record of their work. But you might also want to only require
			&ldquo;publishing&rdquo; for creative projects.</span>

	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span>The discussion questions discuss a number of topics:
			canvases, moving sprites on a canvas, incrementing values, and
			procedures. </span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span>Incrementing values, x=x+1, is a difficult concept and
			you should definitely spend time demonstrating how a memory cell is
			accessed and then changed with this operation, and clearly defining
			set and get operations.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span>You have some leeway in terms of how deep you want to go
			into procedures at this point. The next lessons do not depend on
			procedures, so one option is to just briefly introduce them and move
			on. Other instructors prefer to emphasize procedures early on,
			however.</span>

			(30-90)</span>
	</h1>
	<p class="c3">
		<span>The first customization exercise is really a creative
			task-- the students personalizing the Mole Mash game with their own
			media and sound effects. Though this task doesn&rsquo;t teach new
			programming skills, students are happy to spend ample time working on
			it, and it can really be motivating. Remember, most have never been
			given the capability of modifying software, so being able to create a
			custom game is pretty cool.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span>Another customization task involves speed, and is a good
			way to introduce some math and simple physics, e.g., speed =
			distance/time. </span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span>Another customization task involves introducing an image
			the player doesn&rsquo;t want to hit. For this task, help the
			students to understand that each time the player touches a sprite,
			two events are triggered: 1) Canvas.Touched, and 2)
			ImageSprite.Touched. In the tutorial, Canvas.Touched is used only.
			But if you want to distinguish between which ImageSprite is hit you
			must program each of their Touched event handlers.</span>
