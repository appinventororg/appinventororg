	<h1 >Preparation</h1>
	<p >
		Make copies of the &ldquo;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f4lPDnfaxxKhzkWvoEuCrHNHpJBRWixIsxr8u0zJR9U/">I Have a Dream&rdquo;
			Conceptualize and Customize Worksheet</a>

	<div class="card">
	<h1 >1. Small group discussion of
			concepts/terminology (45)
	</h1>
	<p >
		Hand out the above document and ask the students to form
			groups of two or three to discuss. After a few minutes, lead a
			full-class discussion of the first few questions, then repeat the
			process.
	</p>

	<p >
		Emphasize terminology-- coding is a complete foreign
			language to most students. Draw diagrams of an app&rsquo;s
			architecture, e.g., something like the picture in chapter 14 of the
			App Inventor book: http://appinventor.org/Architecture2
	</p>

	<p >
		You can assign students the homework task of writing out
			answers to the discussion questions, and/or emphasize that the
			questions are similar to what will appear on a quiz.
	</p>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class="card">
	<h1 >2. Customization Exercise
			(45)
	</h1>
	<p >
		The first exercise is about having a speech begin when
			the phone is shaken. Its purpose is to generalize the idea of event
			handler-- in the tutorial a button click triggers the action, but it
			can just as easily be triggered by a different event.
	</p>

	<p >
		The second exercise concerns using only a single Player
			component and switching its Source property dynamically to the file
			you want to play. The purpose is to show that component properties
			can be changed at run-time (in the blocks). Make it clear that the
			Player component is really set up like a music player for which you
			can change the station by changing the Source.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="card">
	<h1 >3. Creative Project
	</h1>
	<p >
		At this stage, the students understand some basics about
			event handling and conditionals, enough to build some simple
			&ldquo;Media Board&rdquo; apps with simple &ldquo;click&rdquo;
			behaviors that show or play media. A sample project page is provided
			at appinventor.org/soundboard
	</p>
	<p >
		The students will come up with many ideas and you will
			need to both encourage their exploration and choosing the proper
			scope/complexity based on the current limitations of their
			programming knowledge.
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li >Tell the students to work in
				groups of 2. The collaboration spurs creativity but keep groups
				small, or have people work as individuals, so everyone learns the
				coding. Pairing students of similar experience/skill level seems to
				work so as to avoid one student (the more skilled) doing the work.</li>
		<li >Show/Discuss some sample projects.
				There are some listed at at appinventor.org/soundboard. Encourage
				them to build something that someone will actually use, whether it
				be an app for a class they are taking, one for their little sister,
				or one they might use themselves.</li>
		<li >Emphasize that this is a project
				for &ldquo;publication&rdquo;, so they should allocate time for
				refining and finishing. This means refining the user interface,
				making sure the app has an icon and good title, and testing that the
				user interface is easily understandable. </li>
		<li >Go over the publication
				instructions at appinventor.org/appPage. Discuss the options for
				publishing which include 1) on their portfolio, 2) on the App
				Inventor gallery, and 3) on Google Play Store, and 4) emailing the
				app to their friends and family</li>
	</ul>
