		<span>Handout the worksheet and break the students into small
			discussion groups. The first question involves reading code and being
			able to trace what happens. It also provides blocks they&rsquo;ll
			need for the code sketching of the other problems.</span>

	<p class="c0">
		<span>The customization problems involve changing the slideshow
			in ways that require the student to iterate backwards
			(PreviousButton) and perform different bounds checks (e.g., when they
			reach the first question). Customizing the app in this way is
			essential for truly understanding the very important fundamental of
			list iteration with an index.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0 c1">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span>There are also some fun customizations including one in
			which the students create a slideshow game with the pictures of all
			their classmates. This is fun and will give students a chance to work
			with media they create.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0 c1">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span>The slideshow, including the suggested &ldquo;Meet your
			Classmates&rdquo; app, uses static data-- the programmer takes the
			pictures and uploads them into the app. This can lead to an
			interesting discussion about apps with dynamic data, e.g., one where
			the app user takes pictures with the app which are put into the
			slideshow. You may have some advanced students who can try this, or
			just use it as a way to motivate the upcoming lessons in the next
			module.</span>
