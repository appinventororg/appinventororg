				motion video below at different speeds by clicking the gear icon
			on the bottom right of the video, choosing "Speed", and selecting various settings.</p>

			<h2>Animation in App Inventor using the Clock Component</h2>
			<p>In App Inventor, you can use the Clock component and its Clock.Timer event
				to facilitate animation. For instance, the following blocks cause a ball to move
				to the right every second:

			<img class="img-responsive center-img" alt="img0"
			src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/CL_B1M.png
			">
			<img class="img-responsive center-img" alt="img0"
			src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/A_SB.gif">
			<p>Notice that the ball is slow and lags. This is because the Clock.Timer
				event triggers every 1000 milliseconds by default. You can change the Clock.TimerInterval
			to make an animation faster or slower-- this is how you control the frames per second.</p>
			
			<p>For instance, if we changed the TimerInterval in the Clock’s properties to 10
			ms instead of 1000 ms, we'd get a faster ball movement:</p>

			<img class="img-responsive center-img" alt="img0"
			src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/CL_B1M.png
			"> <br>
			<p>Now the ball moves smoothly across the screen because it is moving 1 pixel every 10 ms.</p>

			<p>What is the frames per second (FPS) of the animation if the Clock.TimerInterval is set to 10 ms.</p>

				<div id="q6a" class="collapse">
					<p> The Clock.Timer event will trigger every 10 ms. 10 ms is 1/100 of a second, so this means the Clock.Timer
					event will trigger 100 times a second. Thus the FPS is 100.</p>

			<h2>Doing Animation in App Inventor</h2>
			<p>
				Animation is a series of images that are played at fast speeds to
				create an optical illusion of animation. To envision this, think
				about a ball on a canvas that increases its x position quickly enough
				to look like it is moving slowly across the screen (This can be done
				similarly to to how score was incremented in Mole Mash).<br>
