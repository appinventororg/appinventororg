		<h1>Discussion Questions</h1>
	
		<p>1. The Canvas.Touched and Canvas.Dragged event handlers, shown below, have event parameters. Name each event parameter and say what it represents
		</p>

		<img class="img-responsive" alt="img1" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/image01_CCPaintPot.png">
	
		<p>2. Event parameters are different than function call parameters. What are the names of the function call parameters in the event handlers above? Who specifies function parameters? Who specifies event parameters?</p>

		<img alt="img3" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/image03_CCPaintPot.png">
	
		<p>3. What is the purpose of defining a variable for 'dotsize' in the PaintPot app, as shown above? If you were going to allow the thickness of the drawn lines to be changed, would you need a variable?</p>

		<p>4. Define the term variable. How is a variable similar to a property? How is a variable different than a property? </p>
	
		<p>5. One potential customization of PaintPot involves using a Textbox for the dotsize. How is a textbox different from a variable? How is a textbox different from a label?</p>

		<h1>Customization Exercises</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>The user interface in the PaintPot tutorial app does not display the current chosen color-- the user can only tell what color will be drawn by actually drawing. Add immediate feedback for the user so that when he clicks to change color, the UI changes to make it clear which color is chosen(e.g., when a color button is chosen, change the background color of the button to its color, and gray others)</li>
			<li>The dot size used for circle drawing can only be 2 or 8 in the text version of the tutorial. Change this so that the user can enter the dot size with a Slider component, and can change it to any reasonable size (you decide what is reasonable).</li>
			<li>Provide a way for the user to control the thickness of the lines that are drawn, similarly to how the dot size can be changed. Hint: Check out the properties of the Canvas component for one concerning line width.</li>
