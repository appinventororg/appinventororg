		<h4>App Maker cards provide mini introductions to interesting App
			Inventor components and functionality. They are great for exploring
			app building early in the learning process and as an alternative to
			following a step-by-step tutorial.</h4>

		<h4>Here are the cards in <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/sites/all/files/ConceptCards/ai2/AppInventorMakerCards.pdf">PDF form</a>. Print out the PDF two-sided as the cards have front and back. Then cut them to create the full set of cards. The idea is to choose a card that interests you, then create an app that uses the feature.
