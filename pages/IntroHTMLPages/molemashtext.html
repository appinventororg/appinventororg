		<h2>Getting a Mole to Appear</h2>
		<p>To begin, create a new project and drag in a Canvas (under
			Drawing and Animation Drawer). The Canvas component always comes in
			way too small, so let's change its width property to "Fill Parent"
			and its height property to 300 pixels or another fixed amount that
			would allow the Canvas to take up most of the screen's space.</p>

			<div class="col-md-6">

					class="img-responsive center-img">

			</div>

		</div>

		<p>Now that we have the place where our Mole is supposed to appear
			and disappear, let's get a mole on the Canvas. The component you
			should use for the mole is the Image Sprite component (also found in
			the Drawing and Animation Drawer).</p>


		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MMT_imagepsrite.png"
			class="img-responsive center-img">

		<p>If you test your app after dragging in the Image Sprite, you
			will not see an Image Sprite because there is no image for your mole.
			Upload a (small) image into your app and set your ImageSprite1
			picture to the image in the properties in the designer. If the
			picture is too big, either resize it using your computer software, or
			change the ImageSprite size properties (width and height) to be a
			small square (ex width-30; height-30).</p>

		<h2>Fit Within Canvas Height and Width</h2>
		<p>Here, the bug is that the mole can be partly off the screen,
			and not be able to be tapped. The reason for this is that when you
			have an image, the image’s (x,y) position is located at the top left
			corner of the image.</p>
		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_ISS.png"
			class="img-responsive center-img">
		<p>
			Instead of having the mole’s X position go to a random point within
			the entire Canvas width, how far should the mole’s X go? Use the

			that we want the mole to be able to go.

		<h2>Showing Score and the ScoreLabel</h2>

		<br>
		<p>In the example above, there are 2 labels inside of a horizontal
			arrangement. One label displays the text “Score:” and the other label
			showing “0” displays the actual score. The label showing “0” was
			renamed to ScoreLabel so that when one codes, they know which label
			should be the one that numbers get added to.</p>


	</div>

	<div class="card">
		<h2>Make it so that the user can get a point by tapping the mole

		<p>Now that we have the label that will show the score, we can

		<p>Mole.Touched is the event that happens when the mole is touched
			on the Canvas.</p>
		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_Touched.png"

		<p>Which component shows the user their current score? Look at the

		<p>
			<b>ScoreLabel</b>

		<h2>Countdown timer</h2>
		<p>A countdown timer is simply a label that decreases by one every
			second and it ends a game when it reaches 0. This is similar to how
			you would gain a point except it will subtract instead of add and
			would occur at an event that repeats in a loop.</p>
		<p>First we need the label that will show the user how much time
			is left.</p>

			src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_HAComp.png"

		<p>Notice this is being done similarly to how the score was
			incremented, where there are two labels, one that labels the value of
			how much time is left with the word "Time" and another label
			displaying "30" that has the actual amount of time that is left in
			the game. The components were also renamed so that when one is
			coding, they know which label should have 1 subtracted from it.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Next we need a component that will make our TimerLabel decrease
			by 1 every interval of time. Which component should be used?</p>

		<p>Now that we have our clock we just need it to decrease the
			TimerLabel by 1 every second.</p>
		<p>What is the problem that will occur when playing your game if

		<div class="quiz-panel-inner">
