	<p>The Course-in-a-Box is a set of on-line materials to help teachers design
		App Inventor courses and/or modules. The course outline and materials are modeled 
		after Professor David Wolber's course, "Computing, Mobile Apps, and the Web" at the University 
		of San Francisco, which he has taught since a Google App Inventor pilot in 2009. 
		You are welcome to use and have your students use the course materials directly, link to the materials, 
		copy and remix them (citations/links are welcomed!), and pick and choose modules as you like. Whether you are teaching 
		on-line, in-person, or a hybrid "flipped" classroom, the Course-in-a-Box is for you!</p>

		<h3>Extracted from a <a href="https://www.graphite.org/website/appinventororg">Graphite.org</a> review:</h3>
		<p>Appinventor.org was designed for teachers by a university professor. As a 
		result, it offers a rich array of teaching resources, guidance, and tools that 
		are ready-made for classroom use. The "course-in-a-box" offers the materials and 
		an outline to help teachers offer a college-level introduction to programming for 
		non-computer science folks. With some minor modifications, the site could provide 
		the spine for a high school intro to programming course that's accessible to 
		almost any level of student who wants to learn how to code....</p>

		<p>Teachers should think of Appinventor.org as a toolbox packed full of options. 
		First decide exactly what you'd like your students to learn and accomplish -- 
		you can use either the App Inventor book or the course-in-a-box option. 
		Once you've worked through the instructional materials, the next steps might 
		include adding students, or possibly making a few modifications to fit a 
		certain format or learning level.</p>
