		<p>Being able to get a number to increment (or decrement) is an
			important skill in creating any sort of app. Whether it is for adding
			up numbers to show a gamer his or her score, or to show a gamer how
			much time is left.</p>
		<p>If we want to increment the label that displays “0” (meaning
			the label's text would change to 1, 2, 3, 4…) each time it is clicked… Could we use
			the following blocks? Why or Why not?</p>

				<p>You would not be able to use these because the label would

				<p>Yes. In this really silly game, the user scores a point by clicking a button. 
				When the button labeled “Score a Point” is clicked, the ScoreLabel (showing 0 above) changes to 1. 
				If it is clicked again, it changes to 2, and so on.</p>

		<h2>Explained</h2>

		<p>The lighter green block labeled “ScoreLabel.Text” is a “Get” block. “get” means to go look in a 
		memory cell and see what is there. The first time the button is clicked, the “get” returns the initial value of 0, 
		and runs the program of <b>0</b>+1=1. 1 is then set into ScoreLabel.Text (and 1 appears in the user interface). The second time the button 
		is clicked, the current value of ScoreLabel.Text is 1, so <b>1</b>+1=2 is placed into ScoreLabel.Text.<br>
If you want the number to <b>decrement</b>, just change + to -.</p>
