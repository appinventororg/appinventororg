<p>In this module, you’ll learn to build apps that accept user input
	through forms and other means. Instead of working with fixed data (as
	in the Quiz app), you’ll use lists to store data that changes
	dynamically and that must be saved persistently. You’ll build a
	personal NoteTaker app and a MathBlaster app that generates arithmetic
	problems.</p>
