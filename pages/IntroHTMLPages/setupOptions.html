			<h1>Setting Up App Inventor</h1>
			<h4>App Inventor is all web based, and just needs a bit of installation so that you can test your apps. </h4>

			<h3>Option One (Recommended)</h3>
			<h4>Build apps with an Android device and WiFi Connection</h4>
			<img class="responsive-fullwidth-img" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/computer_device.png" width="60%" height="40%">
			
			<h3>Pro</h3>
			<h4>The quickest way to test and the lowest amount of setup.</h4>
			<h3>Con</h3>
			<h4>You have to have an android device. You have to be on a Wifi network that is not heavily firewalled.</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Option Two</h3>
			<h4>If you not have an Android device you can use the Emulator.</h4>
			<h4>If you do not have an Android phone or tablet handy, you can still use App Inventor. Have a class of 30 students? Have them work primarily on emulators and share a few devices.</h4>

			<img class="responsive-fullwidth-img" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/emulator.png" width="60%" height="40%">
			
			<h3>Pro</h3>
			<h4>You do not need a device and can test without a WiFi network</h4>
			<h3>Con</h3>
			<h4>Quite a bit of software to download. Because you do not have a device, you cannot test out the accelerometer and other functions that require an actual device.</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<h3>Option three</h3>
			<h4>No WiFi? Build apps with an Android device and USB Cable</h4>
			<h4>Some firewalls within schools and organizations disallow the type of WiFi connection required. If WiFi doesnâ€™t work for you, try USB.</h4>

			<h3>Pro</h3>
			<h4>You can test without being on a WiFi Network. Fast, and fairly quick test time.</h4>
			<h3>Con</h3>
			<h4>Takes a bit of time to load and there is quite a bit of software to download.</h4>
