                <h1>Lesson Plan: Introduction to App Inventor</h1>

                <p>Setup: Make sure App Inventor is installed on computers and mobile devices are configured correctly.
                    For help with this, see <a href="http://appinventor.org/setup">App Inventor setup.</a></p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Show the following blocks and ask students the question: What does the following app do?
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The app auto-responds to incoming texts and speaks them aloud, sort of an answering machine for SMS texts.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Questions for students: how to send custom response to particular phone number(s)? Other variations?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Tell story: It was written by a beginning USF students, Daniel Finnegan, who called it "No Text While Driving." <a href="http://appinventorblog.com/2010/08/28/idea-transformation-app-inventor-and-state-farm-insurance/"> State Farm later came up with a very similar app.</a>
                    </p>

                        <a href="http://appinventorblog.com/2010/12/16/usf-app-inventor-student-in-wired-magazine/">Wired magazine wrote about it</a>
                    </p>

                        Activity: Let Students Scan the No Texting app onto their phones. They can scan it <a href="/no-text-while-driving">here</a>
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Let them play with it:
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                send a text to a classmate
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                change the custom response
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>


                    
                    <p>
                        Note: to use the app, their phone must have SIM card.
                    </p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Demonstrate Creation of a similar App, also dealing with Texting. Maybe give something away.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The raffle apps listens to incoming texts and adds the number of the sender to a list. When ready, user clicks a button to randomly choose one number from the list and call it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Show the development of the app, then plug your phone in and allow students (contestants) to text your phone. They can use any type of phone, not just android. When done, click the button and the app should call the "winners" phone. Make sure everyone has ringer on as it makes it more fun.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Here are the blocks for Raffle app:
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
