<H1> Add an App </H1>

<p> The template system is dependent upon a specific naming convention -- and the value of the "App ID" field
    is crucial. It must be used as the filename for the PDF, the ZIP, and the APK files for a given app.
    For example, the source code for an app with App ID == "notetaker" must be within
    a file named "notetaker.zip" All of these files must also be placed within a subdirectory
    of the "apps" directory that is also identical to the App ID field. So, for example, notetaker.zip
    would need to be placed within appinventor/apps/notetaker.

    The app screenshot that will appear within the hero unit (the grey box at the top of the
    page) must also be placed within the subdirectory for that particular app, and should be
    named "hero.png"; similarly, the QR image must be name "qr.png".

        are entering fields for the Hello Purr app, make sure this field == "hellopurr".)
