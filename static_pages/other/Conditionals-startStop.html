<h2>{% block title %}Conditionals: How do you program an app to make decisions?{% endblock %}</h2>
{% block description %}
				With App Inventor, you program event handlers-- how an app should
				respond to something like the user clicking a button. But sometimes
				an app shouldn't respond to an event the same every time. This is
				where <span class="empfont">if</span> blocks, known as
				"conditionals", come in. They allow the app to make decisions and
				form the basis of artificial intelligence.

{% block question %} Example 1. How do you start and pause a sound file when the
user clicks a button? {% endblock %}
{% block answer %}
<p>
				This behavior from the <a href="/content/CourseInABox/Intro/IHaveADream">I Have a
					Dream app</a> illustrates the fundamental way that an app makes
				decisions. There is a button with a picture of Martin Luther King on
				it. The action taken when the button is clicked is not always the
				same. If the sound file (MLKâ€™s speech) is playing, it should be
				paused. If it is not playing, it should be started. The <span
					class="empfont">if-else</span> block is used to branch based on the
				situation. It checks the IsPlaying property of the <span
					class="empfont">Player</span> component. If it is true, it pauses
				the speech. If it is false (else), the speech is (re-) started.
