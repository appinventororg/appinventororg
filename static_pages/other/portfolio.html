			<h1>Creating your Class Portfolio</h1>

			<p>These notes describe how to create a "class portfolio" for the
				work you do in class. You'll learn how to create a Google Sites page
				and from this day on you'll post everything you do-- from small lab
				assignments to large, creative projects-- on your portfolio.</p>

				Get a Google Account and Register for Sites. In a browser, go to <a
					href="http://sites.google.com">sites.google.com</a> If you have a
				Google account login. If not, click 'Sign up for Sites' and register
				with Google.
			</p>

			<p>Create a New Site. When you've successfully logged in to
				Google Sites do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Click on 'CREATE'</p></li>

				<li><p>Provide a name for your site, something like 'John
						Smith's App Inventor Site'. Note that the id (not the name) must
						be unique as it will be part of your URL, this shows up below
						where you enter the name for your site as shown in the image
						below.</p></li>

				<p>Add some basic information to the home page. To add or change
					information to your home page, click on "Edit Page" in the
					top-right corner (if you're already in Edit mode, Save and Cancel
					buttons will appear in the top-right corner). On your new home
					page, add some profile information for yourself:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>name and contact information</li>
					<li>short bio</li>
					<li>something about the course you are taking.</li>
				</ul>

					Insert a profile image on your home page You can insert images on
					to your page either from a file on your computer, or from the web.
					First, insert an image from the web. Open another browser window
					and search Google images for a picture you like (go to <a
						href="http://images.google.com/">http://images.google.com</a> to
					search the web for images). When you have found an image you like,
					right click on it and select 'Copy Image URL'(as seen below).
				</p>

				<p class='center-children'>
					<em>This is where you can upload the image.</em>
				</p>

			</div>

			<div class='standard-section'>
				<p>This will put the image link in your copy clipboard. To make
					the image appear on your Google Sites page, first make sure you are
					in 'Edit' mode, then select Insert | Image from the top menu. You
					can then either choose to upload an image from your desktop or
					enter a URL for a picture on the web. If you click on 'Web Address
					(URL)' you can then paste the URL you copied to your clipboard into
					the Image URL box (pictured below). The same image that appeared in
					the Google Image search should appear on your new Google Sites
					page.</p>


				<img src="/assets/img/portfolio/pictureupload.PNG"

				<p class='center-children'>
					<em>What the screen looks like after the URL has been entered
						as the image to use.</em>
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class='standard-section'>
				<p>You can also insert an image from the hard drive of the
					computer. If you have a picture of yourself, great. Perhaps you can
					use a digital camera to take a picture of yourself and then email
					it yourself and upload it on the computer. If you don't want to do
					this right now, just go back to the Google image search and find
					another image from the web. This time, however, right click it and
					select "Save Image As". Save the file onto the desktop of your
					computer. Click Insert | Image again, and browse for the image you
					want on your Google Sites page. When you click 'Add Image' it
					should appear on your page.</p>

				<p>Customize the Sidebar. The sidebar appears on all the pages
					of your site. You can customize it with different items and links,
					and even move it around on the page. Choose the options dropdown
					menu and select edit site layout from there. The Sidebar will be
					highlighted, select the + symbol from there. A dialog will appear
					allowing you to add pages to the sidebar (image below). Select the
					item you would like to add into your page; then add the them.
					Eventually, you'll add links to your major projects and checklists.

				<p>You can also add links to the outside world and other items
					with this option. You'll have to create a new sidebar item, just
					like above except when you choose an option from the pop up menu,
					choose. Choose the "Text" option, as seen below, and click the add
					button. This allows you to put in any components, including links.
					Add this Text navigation below the navigation bar and add links to
					your profiles on Facebook, the course web page, etc.</p>

			<p>Change the logo on your site. In a drawing editor, create a
				logo. It might have your picture on it, or just a nicely styled
				title. Create your logo of dimensions something like 750x140 to fit
				into a Google Sites page. Add it to your site by choosing the
				options dropdown menu in the top-right of the screen, and select
				Edit site layout. Once you are inside of the edit page, select
				Header in the top left of the screen, then hover over the header
				(shown below) and click that, a pop up menu like the ope in the
				image below will appear. Select the Custom Logo option and browse to
				your image, and select OK.</p>
