<h3>Canvas -- a sub-panel of the screen</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The app or a user can draw in it</li>
    <li>The app can animate objects within it</li>
</ul>

<h3>Canvas has an X,Y coordinate system</h3>
<ul>

    <li>X represents the horizontal location of an object. The left-side of the Canvas is X=1. If the Canvas has a width of 300, then the right-side of the Canvas is X=300.</li>
    <li>Y represents the vertical location of an object. The top of the Canvas is Y=1. If the Canvas has a height of 400, then the bottom of the Canvas is Y=400. Note that Y gets bigger as you go down, which is the opposite of the traditional math coordinate system.</li>
</ul>
    
<h3>Canvas properties, functions, and events</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Canvas properties: Width, Height, BackgroundColor, PaintColor</li>
    <li>Canvas functions: DrawCircle, DrawLine</li>
    <li>Canvas events: Touched(x,y), Dragged(startx,starty,previousx,previousy, currentx, currenty)</li>
    <li>note that dragged is triggered many times as user drags finger across the screen</li>
</ul>    

<h3>Instructor Demo</h3>
<p>Demonstrate the following or give some or all of them to your students as challenges:
<ul>
    <li>Drag in a Canvas and set the width of the canvas to "Fill parent" and the height to 400</li>
    <li>Add a button below the Canvas.</li>
    <li>On the Button click, draw a circle at 30,30 no matter where touched</li>
    <li>On Canvas.Touched event, draw a circle at x,y</li>
    <li>Note that event parameters are found in "My Blocks": do not drag from event-handler</li>

    <li>On Canvas.Touched event, show x,y coordinates in a label.</li>
    <li>Draw a circle in middle of canvas no matter where touched</li>
</ul>
