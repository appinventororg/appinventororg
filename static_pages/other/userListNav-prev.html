{% block title %}User List Navigation: How do you step through a list of information?{% endblock %}
{% block description %}
		App Inventor provides a <span class="empfont">for each</span> block for processing a list of information 
			all at once. But what if you have an app, such as a slideshow, in which the 
			user controls the movement through the list?  To program this behavior, you’ll

{% block question %}Example 2. How do you add a previous button to make the slideshow go backwards?{% endblock %}

{% block answer %}
<p>
			This sample is similar to the “Next” button code above but now the index 
			variable decrements and the slideshow goes backward. The if-test checks if 
			the index is greater than 1, because if it is already 1, the first picture 
			is being displayed and we can’t go further back.
