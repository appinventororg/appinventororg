			An app remembers things, it has “hidden” memory. Think of it like a
			spreadsheet of data in the app’s private “brain”. You, the
			programmer, control the memory. When you drag a component (e.g.,
			button, text box) into your app, each of the components has a set of
			<em>properties</em>. These properties are “spreadsheet” cells that
			you can change. You can also define new “spreadsheet” cells called <em>variables</em>
			when you need to remember something. You define a variable when there
			isn’t a component property for storing the information you need.
			Check out these examples of using variables to remember things:

				<h3>Example 1. How do you make it so that each time the user
				clicks a larger circle is drawn?</h3>
				<small> <a href="/VariablesBackForth">example
				2</a>
				</small>
		
				<p>
					When <span class="empfont">Canvas1</span> is touched, <span
				class="empfont">DrawCircle</span> is called to draw a circle at
				the touch location (<span class="empfont">x</span> and <span
				class="empfont">y</span>). The radius <span class="empfont">r</span>
				cannot be a fixed number as we want a different-sized circle each
				time. The variable <span class="empfont">circleSize</span> is used
				to keep track of-- to remember-- the size of the circles each time
				we draw one. <span class="empfont">circleSize</span> is initialized
				to 1 so the first circle drawn is a small dot. At the bottom of
				each <span class="empfont">Canvas1.Touched</span> event handler, <span
			class="empfont">circleSize</span> is doubled. So the second time
			the circle will be of radius 2, then 4, then 8, etc. The variable <span
			class="empfont">circleSize</span> is needed because there is no
			component property that can be used. The component <span
				class="empfont">Canvas</span> has a <span class="empfont">lineWidth</span>
				property, so if you were drawing lines you wouldn’t need to define
				a variable. But <span class="empfont">Canvas</span> doesn’t have a
				<span class="empfont">circleSize </span> property, so you must
				define it as a variable. Want to get a better understanding of what a variable is? Check out this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHYis-DP0oU">Khan Academy video</a>.
