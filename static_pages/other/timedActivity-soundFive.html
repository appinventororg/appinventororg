			{% block title %} Timed Activity: How do you repeat an action, pausing between each iteration?{% endblock %}
			{% block description %}How do you program time? How do you program animation? With many programming languages, concepts like animation are pushed back in the curriculum-- you might not get there until a year or two
    of coursework. With App Inventor’s event-based approach, you can explore timed activity and animation as a beginner. The high-level Clock component serves as an alarm clock, and you use its Timer
    event to trigger timed activity. Check out the following examples:{% endblock %}

{% block answer %}
  <p>
            <span class="empfont">The Clock.TimerInterval</span> property determines how often the <span class="empfont">Clock.Timer</span> event triggers. By default, the timer interval is set to
            1000 ms, or 1 second. If you set it to 5000, the <span class="empfont">Clock.Timer</span> event will trigger every 5 seconds. It is a bit confusing and indirect, because you typically set the <span class="empfont">TimerInterval</span> in
            the Designer, and the <span class="empfont">when Clock.Timer event</span> is in the blocks editor. But just realize that the timer will be triggered every “TimerInterval” milliseconds.
