			{% block title %} Timed Lists: How do you process each item of a list, pausing in between?{% endblock %}
			{% block description %} You can't use a for each or while loop to process a list if timing is 
			involved because those iterative blocks don’t pause between processing each
			 item-- they go too fast! To deal with timing and lists, you define an index 
			 to keep track of the position in the list as processing proceeds, and you 
			 process each item in some event handler. Check out the following examples:{% endblock %}
{% block question %} Example 1. How do you play a list of musical notes?{% endblock %}
{% block answer %}
<p>
			For this example, assume three short sound clips, “do.mp3”, “re.mp3”, 
			and “mi.mp3”, have been uploaded as media for the app. The goal is to play 
			the three notes one after the other.
			</p>
			<p> A musical note takes time to play. 
			If you tried to use a for each block to play a list of notes, they would 
			play on top of each other, as the app doesn’t pause between iterations.</p>
			<p> The solution is event-based. When the user initiates the note playing by clicking 
			a button, you play the first note. You then program the 
			<span class="empfont">Player.Completed</span> event, 
			which is triggered when the <span class="empfont">Player</span> component finishes playing an entire sound
			 clip. In <span class="empfont">Player.Completed</span>, you check where you are in the list, and if you 
			 are not done, you get the next note and play it. The scheme is supported 
			 through the definition of a variable, index, which keeps track of the 
			 current position in the list. It starts out as 1, and is incremented each 
			 time a note completes. The select list item block is used to grab the 
			 “indexth” item to play. 
			 </p>
			<p> The blocks shown would play any list of notes, 
			 but let’s walk through what happens with this particular list. When 
			 the user clicks the <span class="empfont">PlayButton</span>, <span class="empfont">index</span> is set to 1 so that the select list 
			 item block selects the first item, “do.mp3”, which is played.
			 </p>
			<p> 

			When “do.mp3” finishes playing, the <span class="empfont">Player.Completed</span> event handler is triggered. 
			It increments index from 1 to 2, checks if the <span class="empfont">index</span> is past the end of the notes 
			list (it is not), and then selects and plays the second note (“re.mp3”).
			</p>
			<p> 
			When “re.mp3” finishes playing, the <span class="empfont">Player.Completed</span> event handler is triggered a second 
			time. It increments index from 2 to 3, checks if <span class="empfont">index</span> is past the end of the notes 
			(is still is not), and plays the third note, “mi.mp3”.
			</p>
			<p>
			When “mi.mp3” completes, the <span class="empfont">Player.Completed</span> event handler is triggered a third time. 
			index is incremented again, now to 4, and it is now larger than the length of the list. 
			So the “if test” is false and no more notes are played.
