{% block question %} Example 2. How do I define a procedure that can display any list in any label?{% endblock %}
{% block answer %}
<p>
		Instead of actually displaying a list, the procedure does the work of converting a 
		list variable into text which can be put into any label. The procedure is generic-- 
		it takes any list and returns text, and it doesnâ€™t refer to any specific components. 
		Any code that calls this procedure, e.g., <span class="empfont">Screen1.Initialize</span>, will provide the specific 
		list as a parameter to <span class="empfont">listToText</span>, and will place the resulting text in a specific label.
