<H1>Timer Events and Animation</H1>

<H3>Review of apps and events explored so far</H3>
<p>An app is a set of event handlers</p>
<h4>UI events</H4>
<ul>
<li>
when Button.Click
</li>
<li>
when Canvas.Touched, when Canvas.Dragged 
</li>
<H4>External Events</h4>
<ul>
<li>
when Texting.MessageReceived
</li>
<li>
info from web, GPS sensors
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now we'll consider timer events, i.e., when you want something to happen as time passes. A Clock component is used.

Clock, key properties
        timerInterval -- default is 1000 (ms)
        timerEnabled -- default is true, meaning Timer event will trigger every timerInterval

Within a canvas, you can place an ImageSprite or Ball. They only "live" within a Canvas.

Ball and ImageSprite have the same behavior. ImageSprite is different in that you can specify an image file for it.

Instructor demo: A sprite that moves back and forth across the screen
<ol>
<li>
Move sprite  one second after a button is clicked
</li>
<li>
Move sprite back and forth continuously after button is clicked (alternatively when app begins)
</li>
</ol>
