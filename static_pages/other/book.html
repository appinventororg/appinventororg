					The original, App Inventor 1 version of <a
						href="http://www.amazon.com/App-Inventor-Create-Your-Android/dp/1449397484/">
						App Inventor: Create your own Android Apps</a>, published by O'Reilly
					in 2011, is available in PDF form here. The links here get you to
					PDF versions of each chapter, or to a page with the PDF and
					accompanying video lessons. The book was written by USF Professor
					David Wolber along with App Inventor creator and MIT Professor Hal

					<strong>Note: App Inventor 2 is the up-to-date version of
						App Inventor and provides a far better experience. Unless you have
						a reason to use the old version, you should start with or switch
						to App Inventor 2 and the 2014 published <a href="/book2">App
							Inventor 2 book</a>
					</strong>
				</p>

				<h2>Overview of the App Inventor 1 Book</h2>
				<p>The book is organized in a way to motivate learning. The
					first section walks you through the creation of twelve successively
					more complex apps that you can build and customize. Find something
					you'd similar to what you'd like to build and go for it. The apps
					section is followed by a separate "Inventor's Manual" section which
					explains programming and computer science concepts in layperson's
					terms. This section is organized by programming topic as in a
					traditional text.</p>

				<p>Interested in building apps but don't have a year to learn
					Java? Teaching an introductory (CS0) computer science course to
					K-12 or university students? This book is for you!</p>

				<p>The paperback version is a great companion to app building--
					you can use the book to read the tutorial and save your screen for
					all of the App Inventor windows.</p>
