                <p>This site is all about App Inventor for Android, the visual "blocks" language for building mobile
                    apps. The site was developed by Professor David Wolber of the University of San Francisco, who has
                    taught App Inventor courses since 2009. For more information, contact Wolber at wolber@usfca.edu.</p>

                App Inventor is a visual language with a drag-and-drop interface. Here are some
                    of the reasons that even non-technical people can program with it:

                </p>

                

                <ul class="lead" style="font-size: 14px;">
                    <li> No syntax -- The blocks language eliminates the need to remember and type code.</li>
                    <li> Everything is right in front of you -- The components and functions are organized into
                        drawers. Just find, drag, and drop.
                    </li>
                    <li> Events at top level -- "When this happens, the app does this" is the correct conceptual
                        model. Down with Listeners!
                    </li>
                    <li> High-level components -- The app inventor team has built a great library with
                        simplicity the main goal.
                    </li>
                    <li> Only some blocks plug-in -- You can't do things that don't make sense.</li>
                    <li> Concreteness -- You program components, not abstractions.</li>

                </ul>
