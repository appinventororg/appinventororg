			{% block title %} How do you setup an app with multiple screens?{% endblock %}
			{% block description %}  Many apps have multiple screens, e.g., a splash screen
			and the main activity screen of the app. App Inventor provides blocks
			for swapping between screens and for sharing data between them. The following examples 
			illustrate how to set up such an app.{% endblock %}
{% block question %} Example 2. How do you share information between screens?{% endblock %}
{% block answer %}
<p>
	The components and variables in one screen are not available to another. 
	To share information between screens, use a TinyDB component. Though you'll have
	a TinyDB defined on each screen, both really point to the one and only TinyDB database.
	
</p>
<p> One or both screens might change the shared data. But in each screen, you'll need a 
Screen.Initialize as in the blocks shown, to read the current
values in the database.
