			High schools will soon be teaching <strong>AP Computer
				Science Principles</strong>, a much more accessible introduction to computer
			science than the current Java curriculum. This is great news, and <strong>Ralph
				Morelli</strong> has developed an<a href="http://mobile-csp.org/"> AP CSP
				course</a> that uses App Inventor as the programming language! Check out
			his curriculum which has been successfully taught by high school
			teachers who are not formerly trained in Computer Science or Math. An
			on-line version of the course is coming soon!.
