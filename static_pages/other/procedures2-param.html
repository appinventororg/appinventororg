{% block question %} Example 2. How do I define a procedure that can display any list?{% endblock %}
{% block answer %}
<p>
			A parameter is information a procedure needs to do its job. You define parameters 
			for a procedure so that it can be reused more generally. This version of <span class="empfont">displayList </span>
			has been given a parameter list so that it can be used to display any list sent to it. 
			In this case, the variable <span class="empfont">noteList</span> is sent as the parameter, but you could call it from 
			somewhere else in your app with a different list. Note that the original <span class="empfont">displayList</span> procedure
			 was specific to the variable <span class="empfont">noteList</span>-- you couldn’t use it to display other lists.
		</p>
		<p>
		There is one more issue with this procedure which makes it less than optimal for reuse. 
		This procedure displays the list you sent it in a specific label, <span class="empfont">ListLabel</span>. If your app 
		had multiple lists and labels, you’d want your <span class="empfont">displayList</span> procedure to work more generally. 
		The next example will illustrate how to fix this.
