<p>
			App Inventor doesn’t provide a “distance” block for computing the distance between 
			two GPS coordinates. But there are known mathematical formulas for approximating 
			such a distance between two points. The solution is to create your own block-- a procedure-- 
			and plug in one of the known formulas. The procedure “distance”  above uses a formula 
			from <a href="http://geokoder.com/distances">http://geokoder.com/distances</a>. 

		Once you have a distance procedure, you can call it as in the bottom row of the <span class="empfont">LocationChanged</span> 
		event handler. This sample computes the distance from your current location and the University 
		of San Francisco campus.
