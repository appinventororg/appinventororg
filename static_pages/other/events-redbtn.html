			{% block description %}Think of an app like an event-response machine. The user
				clicks a button, the app responds. A text comes in, the app sends an
				auto-reply. A flying saucer hits an asteroid, it blows up. Your job
				as a programmer is to program such event-responses. In App Inventor,
				you do this directly-- your code is essentially a set of
				event-responses, of when-do blocks. Check out the following samples:{% endblock %}
{% block question %} Example 1. How do you turn a button red when the user
					clicks it? {% endblock %}
{% block answer %}<p>
					OK, this is a really silly app but it will get us started. The app
					appears and there is a gray button. When the user touches (clicks)
					the button, the button's color changes to red. The click of the
					button, <b>Button1.Click</b>, is an event, something that can
					happen to the app. The gold when <b>Button1.Click</b> block is
					called an event-handler. The blocks inside it are the response to
					the event. set means to change something, in this case, change the
					button’s <b>BackgroundColor</b> to red. The blocks, as a whole,
					specify that when the user clicks the button it should turn red.</p>
