                        In Module 3, students learn how to program some of the phone's advanced technology: responding to SMS texts, making use of location sensors, building URLs to open maps, scanning barcodes, and text-to-speech. They also are introduced to persistent data, e.g., storing a user's custom response to be sent to incoming texts. Working with the powerful, high-tech components is empowering to students and gives them additional experience with event handlers and conditional statements.                 </p>
