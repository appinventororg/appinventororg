			{% block description %}How do you program time? How do you program animation? With many programming languages, concepts like animation are pushed back in the curriculum-- you might not get there until a year or two
    of coursework. With App Inventor’s event-based approach, you can explore timed activity and animation as a beginner. The high-level Clock component serves as an alarm clock, and you use its Timer
    event to trigger timed activity. Check out the following examples:{% endblock %}
{% block question %} Example 1. How do you play a sound every second?{% endblock %}
{% block answer %}
 <p>
            When the <span class="empfont">Clock.Timer</span> event is triggered repeatedly. Think of it like an alarm clock. The <span class="empfont">Clock.TimerInterval</span> property, determines
            how often the sound will play. By default it is 1000 milliseconds (1 second), so if you don’t change it the sound above will play every second. You can set this property in the designer or
            with blocks.
