<h2 id="download">Download the App Inventor software</h2>


    <p> App Inventor is mostly a cloud tool but it does require you to download some software to your computer. Go to the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/setup-mit-app-inventor.html" target="_blank">Setup page in App Inventor</a> and setup your computer. Here are some notes on the process:
    <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li>Most computers have Java on them already, so for now ignore that step.</li>
        <li>Instead, go straight to Install the App Inventor Setup Software instructions and follow the link for the type of computer you have.</li>
        <li>If you have a Mac, download the .dmg file and double click it. It may start the install process automatically. If not, look on your desktop and you'll see a mounted disk. Click it, then double click on the .pkg file within it. This will start the install process. After installation completes, you are ready to go.</li>
    </ul>

  

<h2 id="create">Create a new project, open the blocks editor
</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Back in <a href="http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu" target="_blank">App Inventor</a> choose the New button on the far left to create a new project. Enter a name for the project. This will open the Component Designer. This is where you'll show how the app will look.</li>
        <li>In the Component Designer, click on Open Blocks Editor. A dialog should appear asking if you want to open or save a file named appinventorForAndroidCodeblocks.jnlp. If one option is to open it with Java Web Start, perfect, do so. The process will take up to a minute, so don't get impatient. If after a minute nothing has happened, look in your downloads folder to see if the file is there, and double click it.</li>
        <li>If the system doesn't ask you to open with Java Web Start, you probably need to configure your system with Java (go back to the Learn | Setup screen). </li>
        <li>The blocks editor is where you'll program the behavior of your app, e.g. what happens when the user clicks on a button.</li>
    </ul>

  
 <h2 id="open">Open an emulator</h2>


    <p>Once you've successfully opened the blocks editor, click on New Emulator. Click OK on the dialog that appears. In about a minute, an emulator (an on-screen phone) will appear.</p>

    
<h2 id="ready">Now you're ready to build an app</h2>

    <p>Most people start with Hello Purr, an app in which touching the phone (or clicking the emulator) causes a cat to meow. Get started using this <a href="/hellopurr-steps">video tutorial</a></p>
