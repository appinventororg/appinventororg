{% block title %} How do you program an app’s event-response behavior?{% endblock %}
{% block description %}Think of an app like an event-response machine. The user
				clicks a button, the app responds. A text comes in, the app sends an
				auto-reply. A flying saucer hits an asteroid, it blows up. Your job
				as a programmer is to program such event-responses. In App Inventor,
				you do this directly-- your code is essentially a set of
				event-responses, of when-do blocks. Check out the following samples:{% endblock %}
{% block question %} Example 2. How do you say "I’m shaking” when the user
					shakes the phone? {% endblock %}
{% block answer %}<p>
					This app has two components, an <b>AccelerometerSensor</b> and a <b>TextToSpeech</b>.
					When the user shakes the phone or tablet, the <b>AccelerometerSensor</b>
					senses the event and the <b>when AccelerometerSensor1.Shaking</b>
					event handler is triggered. The <b>TextToSpeech</b> component is
					called to carry out the response of speaking the words “I’m
					shaking”.</p>
