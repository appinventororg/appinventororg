			Clock componentâ€™s timer on and off. Check out the following examples:{% endblock %}
{% block question %} Example 2. How do you start an animation when the user speaks and stop it when he shakes? {% endblock %}

{% block answer %}
  <p>
            You need two additional components, a <span class="empfont">SpeechRecognizer</span> that can recognize when the user is speaking, and an AccelerometerSensor that senses when the device is
            being shook.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="empfont">Screen.Initialize</span> event handler is triggered when the app begins. The <span class="empfont">SpeechRecognizer.GetText</span> block opens the speech
            recognizer so that it is waiting for the user to say something. When the user speaks, the <span class="empfont">SpeechRecognizer.AfterGettingText</span> event handler is triggered. Here,
            you set <span class="empfont">Clock.TimerEnabled</span> to true so the clock timer will start triggering and the sprite will begin moving. When the user shakes the phone, <span
                class="empfont">AccelerometerSensor.Shaking</span> is triggered, the timer is disabled so the sprite stops, and the <span class="empfont">SpeechRecognizer.GetText</span> is called to
            await the next time the user speaks.
        </p>
