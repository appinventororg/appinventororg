<H1>Publishing your app to the App Inventor Gallery</H1>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span8">
<p>The <a href="http://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT App Inventor Gallery</a> is the main site for sharing your App Inventor apps and checking out the apps and blocks of others. It is like Google Play, except open source-- all of the uploaded apps have source code (blocks) that you can study and remix! Think of it as one of the greatest open source learning studios ever created.</p>
<p>If you're a teacher or run an after-school program, I encourage you to have your students publish their creative projects there. It is amazing how the motivation level rises when one knows that friends and the general public can view the final product of one's work. When my students present their apps, one of the first things they'll say (or be asked) is how many downloads it has on the gallery.</p>
<p>It is also a great place to find apps for remixing. Why start from scratch when you can riff off previous work. Just be sure to give credit (attribution) in the description of your remixed app when you submit it to the gallery.</p>
<p> Here's a snapshot of the home page:</p>
