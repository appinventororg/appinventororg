App Inventor itself has two main screens, the User Interface (UI) Designer and the Blocks editor. When you open App Inventor, it comes up in the UI Designer. This is where you’ll design how the app looks and add the components your app needs. You can click on “Blocks” to view the Blocks Editor. That is where you’ll specify how the app should behave, e.g., when the user touches Martin Luther King, play his speech.

Components and their Properties

Screen1 is a component, in this case a visual component representing the screen of your phone or tablet. Your app will consist of a bunch of components-- buttons, text labels, text boxes for user input, etc. You’re used to seeing such components when you use an app. One thing to realize as a programmer is that, internally, each component is represented with a bunch of memory cells called properties. These memory cells are like spreadsheet cells. The information in them causes the component to look different. So if you change the Title property of the Screen, the label at the top changes.

If you change the Width property of a button to 50, the button’s width changes so that it appears 50 pixels wide. A lot of programming is about changing component properties. You’ll learn how to change these properties in the designer, which changes how the app appears when it starts. Later, you’ll also learn how to change properties in the block editor to program a component to change dynamically as the app is running.


Displaying the MLK Picture.At this point, the media files you uploaded will be packaged with your app but you will not yet see the image or hear the speech in your app. Next, you’ll add an Image component and associate the uploaded image file of MLK with it. Think of an Image component as a container that displays the image in a media file.
