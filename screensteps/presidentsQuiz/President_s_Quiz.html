You could define a screen for each question, but it would be quite difficult to program it that way and equally hard to tailor for new quz apps that you build. Instead, we only define a single screen, and program it so that the information within the components changes as the user clicks "Next". So in the blocks, in the NextButton.Click event, the QuestionLabel.Text property will be changed to the next question, and the QuestionImage.Picture will be set to a different image file name.

Because there is only one screen, we define 'hidden' variables to store all of the questions and answers. These are 'hidden' in the sense that the app only displays one at a time.

When the app begins, it will set up spreadsheet-like memory cells and place the question, answer, and picture data in those cells. The list variables can be indexed. So, for instance, the value of answerList[1] is "Roosevelt", answerList[2] is "Carter", and so on. The index variable is not a list but a single number. It keeps track of where the user is in the quiz. So if index is 2, we are on the second question (and answer/picture).</p><p>You define a list with the "make a list" block. When you drag it out, it has only two items. But if you click the blue icon, you can specify that the list should have more items.

But then if the question changed, or we repurposed our code for a different quiz, the blocks wouldn't work. This is a great example of how code often needs to use abstract references as opposed to "concrete" ones-- it makes the code more flexible and reusable.</p></div>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>	<div id="step_8" class="lessonStep top">	        <h2 class="StepTitle">Show the next question and picture when the Next button is clicked.</h2>		<div class="image fullsize"><a href="images/President_s_Quiz/media_1386279942894_lg.png" rel="prettyPhoto" class="image" target="_blank"><img src="images/President_s_Quiz/media_1386279942894.png" width="580" height="274" alt="Show the next question and picture when the Next button is clicked." /></a><div class="caption"><a href="images/President_s_Quiz/media_1386279942894_lg.png" rel="prettyPhoto" target="_blank">Zoom</a></div></div> <div class="instructions">  <p>The index variable tells us which question the user is on.

So if its 1 it becomes 2, it its 2 it becomes 3, and so on. The "if" block checks to see if we are at the end of the list. We could check if index &gt; 3, but then if we added a new question to the quiz, the code wouldn't work.

If you understand what is meant by the "indexth" item in a list, you're starting to get it. Basically, we want to look in the index variable's memory cell, see what number is in there, and then go get that answer (the indexth item).  Note that our whole scheme is based on the assumption that we've syncrhonized the question and answer list: the first question goes with the first answer, and so on.</p></div>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>	<div id="step_10" class="lessonStep top">	        <h2 class="StepTitle">Clean-Up</h2>		<div class="image fullsize"><a href="images/President_s_Quiz/media_1386282828828_lg.png" rel="prettyPhoto" class="image" target="_blank"><img src="images/President_s_Quiz/media_1386282828828.png" width="580" height="277" alt="Clean-Up" /></a><div class="caption"><a href="images/President_s_Quiz/media_1386282828828_lg.png" rel="prettyPhoto" target="_blank">Zoom</a></div></div> <div class="instructions">  <p>The bottom two blocks are added to clean up the user interface.

You can use it to build a study guide for a class you're taking, or a sports or history quiz to stump your friends. One USF student built a quiz app to help his father study for his US citizenship exam. Besides customizing the content, you might try:</p><ul><li>Changing the user interface-- add a previous button so the user can go backward, or stop the quiz when the last question is reached.</li><li>Make the quiz multiple choice. Hint: make a new list for AnswerChoices, and make each item of it a list with the answer choices.</li></ul></div>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>		</div>	</div>	</body></html>
